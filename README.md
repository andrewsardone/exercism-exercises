I was curious about [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/), a tool that provides a
review system for code exercises across languages.

I installed [the CLI tool](http://exercism.io/help/cli) and
[fetched](http://exercism.io/help/fetch) the default set of exercises. I'll
play around and check-in exercises as I complete them.
